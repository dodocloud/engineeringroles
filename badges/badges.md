### What are badges?
The badges are a complement system to the Ladder - while ladder outlines career paths, the badges reward behaviors and achievements we respect and appreciate in our fellows.

### How can I create a badge?
Simple. Badges must meet the following criteria:

###### Example Badge: *Good presenter*
Do: Presented to an audience of at least 50 people
Don't: Had a nice, well structured presentation

#### 2. A badge must be achievable by one person in reasonable time
###### Example Badge: *CR Knight*
Do: Performed 1000 code reviews
Don't: Invested 100000 hours reviewing code

###### Example badge: *CR Knight*
Do: Performed 1000 code reviews
Don't: Performed a code review in full plate armor [^1]
